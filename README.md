# Machine Learning for *in situ* Dhotoluminescence Data of Perovskite Photovoltaics


This repository contains the corresponding code for the paper **"Process Insights into Perovskite Thin-Film Photovoltaics from Machine Learning with In Situ Luminescence Data"** and the dataset (*add link*)

## Reproducing the results

This repository contains all data and code needed to reproduce the results of the paper **"Process Insights into Perovskite Thin-Film Photovoltaics from Machine Learning with In Situ Luminescence Data"**.   
The folder "extracted_features" contains the extracted features used in the paper, namely the PL transients and as well as the extracted single in situ feature 1 to 3 and the ex situ feature. The data is saved in the *.h5py format and both test and training file contain a pandas table, where each row contains a solar cell sample. 


With the following command, the packages used in the 4 notebooks can be installed from the provided requirements.txt file:
`
pip install -r requirements.txt
`
## extracting the entire dataset 

The dataset is available on zenodo (*add link*) as a hdf5-file which can be extracted
